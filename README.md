Calculator Using Html, Css And JavaScript
A basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes two numerical inputs and an operator, and then calculates the result based on the chosen operator.
The calculator is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML defines the user interface, which consists of input fields for the two numbers and the operator, a button to trigger the calculation, and an output field to display the result.
